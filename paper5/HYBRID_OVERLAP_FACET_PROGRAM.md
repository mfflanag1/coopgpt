# Hybrid overlap and rooted-facet program

Date: 2026-08-10

## 1. Status

The open target is

```text
O(x,z):=sum_i min(x_i,z_i)
       >= 4n T/[n^2-(n mod 2)]                         (H)
```

for `x=Lmin(v)`, `z=Lmax(v)`, and every singleton-normalized exact
`n`-player game with `n>=6`.  This note records one new structural theorem
for the sharp family, one falsified strengthening, and the exact boundary of
what the one-packet theory currently gives on the facet side.  It does not
claim a proof of `(H)`.

The conclusion is that the correct missing object is a **fractional coupling
of rooted Lmin circuits with an Lmax over-cover**.  A literal partition of
the players is already false at six players, while treating the Lmin packet
itself as one exact-cone facet is also false in general.

## 2. Shared-hinge theorem for the sharp family

For the master family `G(p,k)`, write

```text
N={0} disjoint-union O disjoint-union B,
|O|=p, |B|=k, T=pk,
C_b={0} union (B\{b})       (b in B).
```

The known closed forms are

```text
x_0=p^2(k-1)/(p+1),       x_i=p/(p+1)       (i!=0),
z_0=z_b=p(k-1)/k          (b in B),
z_o=1/k                   (o in O).
```

### Theorem (common normal hinge)

The same `k` coalitions `C_b`, all tight at both `x` and `z`, support the
following three systems.

1. A first-stage Lmax over-cover:

   ```text
   sum_b (1/k^2) 1_(C_b) = alpha,
   alpha_0=1/k,
   alpha_b=(k-1)/k^2,
   alpha_o=0.
   ```

   Thus `eta=0`, `sum alpha_i=1`, and `alpha.x=max z`.

2. A first-stage Lmin under-cover:

   ```text
   sum_b 1/[k(p+1)] 1_(C_b) = xi 1_N-beta,
   xi=1/(p+1),
   beta_o=1/(p+1),
   beta_b=1/[k(p+1)],
   beta_0=0.
   ```

   Thus `sum beta_i=1` and `beta.z=min x`.

3. For every `b in B`, a rooted Lmin circuit:

   ```text
   1_(C_b)+sum_(o in O)1_({0,o})+1_({0,b})
     -(p+1)1_({0}) = 1_N.                              (R_b)
   ```

   This is the block-star system with root `{0}` and peripheral partition

   ```text
   B\{b}, {b}, and {o} for o in O.
   ```

   Hence it is indecomposable and defines an exact-cone facet by the standard
   semi-balanced facet criterion.  Its slack inequality is saturated at `x`.

### Proof

Every identity is coordinatewise.  In the first, player `0` belongs to all
`k` hinges, a player of `B` belongs to `k-1`, and a player of `O` belongs to
none.  In the second, the same loads are respectively
`1/(p+1)`, `(k-1)/[k(p+1)]`, and zero, which equal `xi-beta_i`.

For `(R_b)`, every non-root player belongs to exactly one positive coalition.
The root belongs to all `p+2` positive coalitions, and subtracting `p+1`
leaves load one.  The supported sets are exactly a block star, so the
dimension-free result in `paper3/BLOCK_STAR_FACET_THEOREM.md` supplies
indecomposability.  Finally, all singleton values vanish and direct
substitution gives

```text
sum_(o in O) s_x({0,o}) + s_x({0,b})
  = (p+1)s_x({0}),
```

so the facet budget is tight.  QED.

### Overlap factorization

Let `A={0} union O`, so `|A|=p+1` and `|B|=k`.  Coordinatewise minima give

```text
O(A)=T/k,             O(B)=T/(p+1).
```

Therefore

```text
O/T = 1/k+1/(p+1) = n/[k(p+1)].                       (F)
```

The sharp denominator is not accidental: the Lmin and Lmax normals share a
tight-coalition hinge, each hinge completes to an active rooted facet, and
the two carrier sizes enter reciprocally.  Balancing them minimizes `(F)`.

The solver-free verifier

```bash
python3 verifiers/divergence/verify_balanced_family_shared_hinge.py \
  --output verifiers/divergence/balanced_family_shared_hinge.json
```

checks both balanced seven-player orientations `(p,k)=(2,4),(3,3)`, every
incidence and objective identity, core membership, every rooted slack
equality, and the sharp overlap.  It uses the proved selection formulas;
generic staged recomputation is separate existing evidence.

## 3. A clean strengthening that is false

The factorization above suggests asking for a balanced carrier partition in
every game.  Put `w_i=min(x_i,z_i)`, `a=floor(n/2)`, and `b=ceil(n/2)`.
The tempting statement is that some `A`, `|A|=a`, satisfies

```text
w(A)>=T/b,             w(N\A)>=T/a.                   (IP)
```

Adding `(IP)` proves `(H)`.  However `(IP)` is false already at `n=6`.
Two archived exact pairs of total five have overlap multisets

```text
{1,1,1/2,1/2,1/2,0}.
```

Every three-element submultiset has sum at most `3/2` or at least `2`, so no
`3|3` split gives at least `5/3` on both sides.  Their total overlaps are
`7/2>10/3`; thus they do not challenge `(H)`.  They only refute the integral
carrier proof.

Reproduce the exact archive audit with

```bash
python3 verifiers/divergence/audit_hybrid_carrier_split.py verifiers \
  --output verifiers/divergence/hybrid_carrier_split_audit.json
```

It checks 375 archived six-player pairs and records exactly the two failures.
The audit finds no archived seven-player records in that data format, so the
closed-form seven-player hostile check is reported separately.

Allowing fractional player membership repairs the granularity defect, but by
itself merely convexifies the desired scalar inequality and supplies no new
game-theoretic restriction.  The fractional weights must therefore be
generated by the packet/over-cover incidence systems, not chosen after seeing
the overlap vector.

## 4. What one-packet theory gives on exact-cone facets

The strongest correct statement is a relative circuit theorem, not a global
facet correspondence.

At a slack Lmin richer suffix `H`, the one-packet theorem selects a rooted
signed incidence relation with at most `n` positive coalitions.  Projecting
incidence vectors modulo `1_N`, its support contains a conformal circuit with
`H` as its unique negative element.  Thus, for any fixed menus of tight
protectors and rooted completions, all candidate atoms can be enumerated by
exact rational circuit enumeration.  Each atom is a pure minimal
semi-balanced system and gives a valid exact-game inequality.

This yields an exact algorithm:

1. enumerate minimal balanced rich-trace packets (support at most `|H|`);
2. lift one tight protector per trace;
3. complete the poorer load by rooted spokes;
4. enumerate conformal circuits retaining the negative root;
5. apply the published indecomposability test to decide which circuits are
   exact-cone facets;
6. retain the labels “Lmin-tight protector” and “rooted completion” when
   coupling them to the opposite selection.

The last labels are essential and are not part of the ordinary exact cone.
There are two sharp obstructions to a stronger claim:

- the unrooted Lmin-selected atom is always decomposable, so it is never a
  facet (`paper3/ATOMIC_LMIN_OBSTRUCTION_REDUCTION.md`);
- rooting does not always make it indecomposable: the seven-player
  three-trace atom still decomposes, although it factors into two active
  indecomposable facets.

Accordingly the one-packet theory does **not** classify facets of the full
exact-game cone.  It gives a finite, dimension-free support reduction and an
algorithmic classification of a **relative rooted coupling cone**.  The
standard exact-cone facet catalogue can classify the factors after the Lmin
selection has produced them, but it cannot recover the staged selection
labels or prove hybrid overlap on its own.

## 5. The precise missing lemma

The first-stage aggregate pair is insufficient even at six players, by
`TWO_PACKET_EXACTIFICATION_BOUNDARY.md`.  The integral carrier theorem is
also false by Section 3.  A valid all-dimension bridge must use the complete
staged Lmin pinning data.

The minimal live target is therefore:

> **Compatible fractional-hinge lemma.**  From a sparse Lmax top over-cover
> and the complete staged rooted Lmin circuit chain, construct nonnegative
> coupling weights, before inspecting `min(x_i,z_i)`, whose incidence loads
> imply
> `sum_i min(x_i,z_i)>=nT/floor(n^2/4)`.

The theorem must allow multiple rooted facets and fractional sharing of a
player between the two carrier roles.  It must specialize on `G(p,k)` to the
common-hinge systems in Section 2.  Any proposed version must first reject:

1. the exactified two-first-stage-packet obstruction (overlap `2/3`, trial
   overlap `1/2` before later-stage repair);
2. the two integral-carrier failures in Section 3;
3. the nonuniform seven-player majorization counterexample; and
4. both balanced seven-player orientations `(2,4)` and `(3,3)` at equality.

This is outcome D in the research hierarchy: a precise minimal missing lemma,
plus a new exact equality correspondence and two hostile falsification tests.
It is meaningful structural progress, but not yet the requested all-`n`
breakthrough.
